    "We serve a client population of retirees who are looking to move to the beautiful island of Oahu, Hawaii. Being that the majority of our clients are over the age of 65, it is important that they relocate to a neighborhood with easy access to medical care. Areas with higher concentrations of hospitals and medical facilities are preferred. Secondary would be easy access to alternative care and wellness centers.\n",
